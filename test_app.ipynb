       "'Based on the provided context, which is empty, I cannot give you a tailored answer. However, I can provide a general definition.\\n\\nFilm noir is a cinematic term used primarily to describe stylish Hollywood crime dramas, particularly those that emphasize cynical attitudes and sexual motivations. The term is French for \"black film\" (literal) or \"dark film\" (closer meaning), and it was first applied to Hollywood films by French critics who noticed the trend of how dark, downbeat, and black the looks and themes were of many American crime and detective films released in France following World War II.\\n\\nFilm noir of the 1940s and 1950s is associated with a low-key, black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography. Common themes in film noir include murder, crime, mystery, and the femme fatale. Many film noirs tend to revolve around an existentially disillusioned male protagonist - often a detective or an otherwise tough character who encounters a seductive, mysterious woman whose charms ensnare him into a web of intrigue and danger.\\n\\nThe genre\\'s typical cinematographic style includes stark light/dark contrasts, dramatic shadow patterning, the use of flashbacks, intricate plots, and an underlying existentialist philosophy. Not all film noirs necessarily adhere to all these characteristics, as it is a style rather than a strict genre, and its parameters are often debated among film historians and critics.'"

       "'Film noir is a cinematic term used primarily to describe stylish Hollywood crime dramas, particularly those that emphasize cynical attitudes and sexual motivations. The term is French for \"black film\" and was first applied by French critics to American thrillers from the 1940s and 1950s that were marked by a mood of pessimism, fatalism, and menace. Classic film noir developed during and after World War II, taking advantage of the post-war ambience of anxiety, disillusionment, and a sense of foreboding.\\n\\nFilm noir is known for its black-and-white visual style, which has roots in German Expressionist cinematography. It often involves a crime story, with the central figure being a hard-boiled detective or a flawed protagonist who operates in a corrupt legal or political system. Common themes include the nature of evil, the menace of urban life, existential despair, and the questionable moral choices of the characters. The narrative is frequently non-linear, with the use of flashbacks and voice-over narration.\\n\\nIconic examples of film noir include \"The Maltese Falcon\" (1941), \"Double Indemnity\" (1944), \"The Big Sleep\" (1946), and \"Touch of Evil\" (1958). The influence of film noir has extended beyond the classic era to neo-noir films of later decades, which incorporate noir elements into modern settings and utilize color cinematography.'"
